Subject: Complaint about rash bike riders.

Hello Mr.Sharma, Hope this mail finds you well.
I am William , member of Xyz Society. From past few days I and our society members are noticing that some bike riders used to come and 
creates nuisance with their rash bike riding every evening outside our society.
At evening our society children goes out for playing, our old people go out for a walk and also many people passing through that place.
Due to this, any incident can take place there. It can cause any unaware incident which leads to their or other people loss.
So for prevention and safety of people as well as riders, I request you to take an action against those bike riders.

Regards,
William.
